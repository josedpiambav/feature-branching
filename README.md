# GitHub Action Feature Branching

Automates the merging of tagged Pull Requests into a pre-release branch, keeping your main branch clean and stable

## üöÄ Main features

- **Intelligent Automatic Merge:** Combines PRs with a specific tag in a time branch (`pre-main`)
- **Quality Control:** Prevents unapproved merges on the main branch

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example of use

1. Create the file `.github/workflows/feature-branching.yml`:

  ```yaml
    name: Continuous deployment

    on:
    workflow_dispatch: {}
    pull_request:
      types: [labeled, unlabeled, synchronize, ready_for_review]
      branches: [main]
    push:
      branches: [main]

    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: read

    jobs:
      merge-features:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: Checkout
          uses: actions/checkout@v4
          with:
            fetch-depth: 0

        - name: Merge Labeled PRs
          uses: docker://ghcr.io/josedpiambav/feature-branching:1.0.0
          with:
            github_token: ${{ github.token }}
            owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
            repo: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
            trunk_branch: "main"
            labels: "next-feature"
  ```
